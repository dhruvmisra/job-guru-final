          <p class="study-text">Life seemed like a bed of thorns until I came across Pushkar Sir’s
            Personality Development course, who made it seem like a bed of roses. The classes were not mere 
            lectures, rather they were therapeutic sessions for me. After each class I felt calmer, happier 
            and more positive. Pushkar Sir delivers the lectures in a very practical and simple manner. 
            One learns to identify his or her true personality, learns to have a grip over ones feelings, 
            activate the "best version" and also how to have a better self-image and esteem. Pushkar Sir’s 
            Personality Development classes are EXCELLENT. Thanks a lot Pushkar Sir. Join it and feel the 
            positive change in you.</p>

          <p class="study-text">I always had difficulty in managing my emotions. I joined Pushkar Sir’s classes with 
            the intention of starting a journey towards becoming a better person. I thoroughly enjoyed all the 
            classes, and my favorite was the one where I realized that everyone of us has a child, parent, and an 
            adult in us; and it is this interplay, which constitutes our personality. Undoubtedly, I find myself 
            to be a better person, than the one I was, before I joined the course.</p>

          <p class="study-text">Pushkar's Personality Development course was a good experience for me. 
            I had read lots n lots of self-help books before joining this course and because of those books and 
            self-introspection, I knew what was wrong with me and what I need to do to get myself on track but 
            every time I tried and I failed. When I first joined this course, I never thought of it to be focusing 
            mostly on your behavior analysis to enhance your personality. Well, here in this Personality Development 
            course I became aware of the link I have been missing that could help me come out of the depths of my problems. 
            I would say this course is basically an amalgamation of every possible self-help book and that too in brief. 
            You will be able to analyze your life and would be able to demarcate good and bad ,but in the end, it would 
            be up to you to help yourself and decide what you want for yourself. </p>

          <p class="study-text">I joined the personality development course by Pushkar Raj Thakur six months back. 
            The course content is very good and it helped me a lot in realizing my abilities and more importantly 
            my problem areas. Pushkar’s course almost had all the solutions of sall my problems. I joined the course 
            with a motive to develop self-confidence and communication skills which I required to have before starting
            my job as I got placed in TCS (Tata Consultancy Services). Now when I am working, I am realizing the importance
              of the course which I did. I am more confident, efficient and I know my strengths and weaknesses. 
              Personality development is a life-long process and it requires a lot of efforts and 'consciousness' 
              from one's side, but the personality development course gave this process a right direction and the 
              motivation it requires. Rest depends on the individual. Thanks Pushkar for your support and help. Thanks a lot.</p>
